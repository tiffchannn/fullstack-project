# BE Scaffolding

## Notes

- Everything in this project is yours to blow away or build around
- A default superuser with username `admin` and password `password` is in the db.sqlite3 example db
- Enter the `intsureview_be` directory and type `poetry install` to gather all requirements
- Run demo server with `poetry run python manage.py runserver`
- Go to http://localhost:8000 to view the HTML interface for the django rest framework
- A .envrc file will auto load the virtual environment for python if you're using `direnv`
- With direnv, you do not need `poetry run` before your python commands
